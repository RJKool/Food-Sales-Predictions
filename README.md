Author:  Rashad N. Campbell

GOAL:  Create a prediction model to forcast total sale prices of food items at multiple outlet store types.

OVERVIEW OF DATA:
Individual items are represented by these attributes:
 1)   Item_Identifier
 2)   Item_Weight
 3)   Item_Fat_Content
 4)   Item_Visibility
 5)   Item_Type
 6)   Item_MRP
 7)   Outlet_Identifier
 8)   Outlet_Establishment_Year 
 8)   Outlet_Size
 9)   Outlet_Location_Type
 10)  Outlet_Type 
 11)  Item_Outlet_Sales 

Some attributes may be removed from the model because of their low or non-relevance to the prediction of the total sales of individual items.
